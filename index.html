          <p>
            Formerly a student at Rennes School of Business, I decided at the
            end of 2020 to take a break from my studies in order to refocus on
            my professional project which was not yet fully developed at that
            time. During this year's break, I joined the Cr√©dit Mutuel de
            Bretagne for seven months as a remote customer advisor. This
            experience allowed me to discover the world of employment and made
            me discover my attraction for customer relations. Thanks to this
            year, I was able to refine my career plan. This enriching experience
            allowed me to confront myself very concretely to the world of work
            during seven complete months. I was thus able to identify my
            qualities and my defects and to work on them. However, I would still
            like to deepen my knowledge in the commercial field. That's why I am
            presenting myself to you today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rigorous, motivated and dynamic, I would like to use all my skills
            within your company in order to develop new ones during my
            apprenticeship on the field. Joining
            <b>your company</b> as an apprentice business developer represents
            for me an opportunity to learn more about the digital business. This
            experience will allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge in the
            field and to contribute to the development of the company.

          <p>
            Negotiation is a key skill in business development. I have often had
            to negotiate in order to convince a client to buy a product, either
            in my current job or during my client meetings with Bretagne
            Conseil.

            my process.

            I've always liked numbers and it's important for me to have facts
            and data before I discuss a topic. It also works when you want to
            convince a client or a prospect that the product you are offering is
            the right one for them.

          <p>
            I'm 15 years old I love football and I want to become a professional
            player. I'm also aware that it's important for me to be serious in
            class. In my last year of high school I understand that I will never
            be a professionnal player. It's time to focus on school and to
            secure a future.

          <p>
            As I had fairly good grades in my last year of high school and
            succeeded in passing my baccalaureate, my teachers advised me to go
            to a preparatoty class in order to get into a Business School. I
            went ahead without knowing that this experience would change my
            life. I went ahead without knowing that hese two years would be the
            most exciting and challeging years of my life.

            A new adventure with lots of things to learn. with my team, we work
            with small companies but also with large groups; an opportunity for
            me, who doesn't have much professional experience, to learn more
            about this world and to craft my skills. At the End of the year i'm
            going to look for an apprenticeship in order to learn even more
            about the business world. However my career plan isn't fully
            developed. <br /><b>September 2020 </b>: My first real failure... I
            couldn't find an apprenticeship and I can't afford the school !
            Quick ! I need to find a solution.

          <p>
            So here I am... I negociated a gap year with my school in order to
            find a solution. I don't want to waste this year. I need to find
            something interesting, I need to learn something new, something
            valuable. I need to strenghten my career plan and come back on the
            apprenticeship market. I won't quit, I never quit !
